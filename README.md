# Business-Website
The Zone: Co-Working Space | Business Website built w/ React Tailwind

The website is built using Tailwing CSS and React dynamic components, state hooks, and conditional rendering. I decided not to build the backend for it, however the neat and scalable structure of the frontend makes it extremely easy to integrate the backend features, like for instance connecting it to a database, and working with forms. 

The design of the website is inspired by and based on Camp David - a co-working space.
